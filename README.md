# Trees of Paris

This app doesn't really do anything yet.

For now you can use it to visualize frequency data about the trees on public land in the city of Paris within a particular arrondissement or near a geographical point.

This app uses MongoDB, Express, and Angular 5, with some cool node packages and libraries also!
